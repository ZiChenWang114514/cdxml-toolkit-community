# Project Instructions

- Preserve the `cdxml_toolkit` import package and the 15 compatible core MCP tool names.
- Use `cdxml_toolkit.mcp_runtime` for the complete service and `cdxml_toolkit.mcp_server` only for core compatibility work.
- Ground molecular connectivity in a trusted user value, resolver, parser, or OCSR result. Do not invent SMILES.
- Route structural changes through `modify_molecule` and inspect its MCS diff.
- Preserve inputs. Generated artifacts use new paths unless overwrite permission is explicit.
- Keep native ChemDraw work in isolated workers and under the shared native resource lock.
- Do not record molecular content, file contents, credentials, or tool arguments in metrics or health responses.
- Regenerate `docs/mcp-tools.md` and `docs/mcp-schema.json` after changing the tool registry.
- Run `pytest -m "not network" -q`, package checks, and applicable native probes before release.
